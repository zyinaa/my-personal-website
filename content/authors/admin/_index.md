Hi, welcome to my homepage where you can learn my background and check on my updates. \
I got my Bachelor of science degree in mathematics at HKUST in 2021, while my major is statistics and financial math. My final year's capstone project is on time series analysis and its application on portfolio optimization. Since graduation, I have been working on my current position as an Instructional Assistant and Research Assistant of ISOM. I have been collaborating the work with my supervisors, and working on quantitative finance subjects including methods of machine learning, deep learning, classification and clustering, sentiment analysis, time series and so on. I also collaborate the project of High-dimensional Neyman-Pearson Classification with Applications to Textual Data Analysis led by professor Lucy XIA.\
My research interests include macro-economics topics especially the "Three agricultural problems" in China, and implementing machine learning algorithms in financial market and big data research.
